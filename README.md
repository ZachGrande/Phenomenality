## Start Localhost

`Ctrl + C` to cancel

## Deploy Build to GitHub Pages

## Make a New Branch

Do these two steps in sequence to (1) make a new branch and (2) publish it to GitHub.

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

`git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>`

Edit the branch as much as you'd like, push/pull freely, then when work is done make a Pull Request on the GitHub site.

### Double Checking the New Branch

If you run `git status`, the terminal should say

`On branch <branch-name>`  
`Your branch is up to date with 'origin/<branch-name>'.`
