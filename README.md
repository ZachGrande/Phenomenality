<h2>Our Mission </h2>

Gender minorities entering the technology field experience imposter phenomenon (IP) at a disproportionate rate as compared to their male counterparts. Phenomenality aims to mitigate the effects of perceived inadequacy by encouraging users to reflect on and celebrate their daily accomplishments in a journal-like manner. Through consistent, affirmative self-talk, a Likert scale quiz, and personalized IP alleviation strategies, Phenomenality provides gender minorities with the resources to optimize their potential, boost their confidence, and ultimately flourish in their professional environments.

## Features
* Record your daily professional accomplishments
* Tag with industry-related terms to promote quick and easy filtering when recalling
* Take a quiz to learn about five of the widely-recognized IP archetypes
* Learn about IP mitigation strategies unique to your IP archetype
